Used modern HTML and CSS to create a completely responsive Music Player App Design with my preferred color theme. Used CSS Flexbox, Media queries for responsive design and CSS transition for some cool animation effects. This project contains Sidebar, Music Player, Header, Genre and Top Musics sections!
Learned this stuff from youtube got inspired and just implemented!
